# e-commerce-site

## Description

For this UofT Bootcamp challenge we had to create the backend for an e-commerce site. It tested our understanding of how routes work when sending CRUD requests to the sql database. The greatest challenge I found with this challenge was establishing the many to many relationship between products and tags.

## Installation

Run through the command line terminal

## Usage

When in the develop folder of the e-commerce application, first sign into mysql and run the schema with source ,/db/schema.sql; Next quit out of mysql and use npm run seed to seed the database. After seeding is successful, run the server by using node server.js. Now that the server is live you can use CRUD requests to interact with the product database, made easy with an application like Insomnia or Postman.
